# Brain CLI Tool - Development Progress

## Project Overview

**Brain** is a CLI tool that solves the context-switching problem for developers
with busy family lives. It captures your current thoughts along with git
activity, uses AI to interpret the technical context, and helps you seamlessly
resume where you left off.

### Core Commands

- `brain save "debugging auth middleware - tokens expiring randomly"` - Capture
  current context
- `brain resume` - Show last context with AI analysis and suggested next steps
- `brain list` - View recent context history
- `brain config` - Manage settings and API keys

### Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Deno (TypeScript)
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API
- **Storage:** Local JSON files in `~/.config/brain/`

```

**Completed Development Phases:**

1. ‚úÖ **Phase 0:** Project setup and planning
2. ‚úÖ **Phase 1:** Technical setup & architecture
3. ‚úÖ **Phase 2:** TDD implementation of all core components
4. ‚úÖ **Phase 3:** CLI integration and end-to-end functionality
5. ‚úÖ **Phase 4:** User experience polish and documentation
6. ‚úÖ **Phase 5:** Build optimization and distribution packaging
7. ‚úÖ **Phase 6:** Website creation and deployment automation
8. ‚úÖ **Phase 7:** Repository Context Isolation (Complete)

**üéØ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED:** Brain CLI with repository isolation is
production-ready!

### ‚úÖ Phase 7 Progress: Repository Context Isolation

**üéØ Goal:** Eliminate context leakage between repositories - ensure
`brain resume` only shows contexts from the current repository.

**Strategy:** Repository path-based identification for robust, unique
identification.

**Progress Summary:**

- ‚úÖ **Step 17:** Repository-Aware Data Models
  - Added `RepositoryInfo` interface with `path` and `identifier` fields
  - Updated `WorkNote` interface to include `repositoryInfo: RepositoryInfo`
  - Updated all model tests to include repository information
  - Updated CLI commands to create `repositoryInfo` from git context
  - All tests passing (6 model tests, including new RepositoryInfo test)

- ‚úÖ **Step 18:** Repository-Aware Storage Tests (TDD)
  - Created `tests/storage-repo-isolation.test.ts` with 7 comprehensive test
    scenarios
  - Enhanced `Storage` class with repository-aware methods:
    - `getWorkNotesByRepository()` - Filter all contexts by repository
    - `getRecentWorkNotes()` - Added optional `repositoryId` parameter
    - `getLastWorkNote()` - Get latest context with repository filtering
  - All 64 tests passing (7 repository isolation tests added)
  - Complete cross-repo isolation and same-repo identification working

- ‚úÖ **Step 19:** Enhanced Git Analyzer
  - Added `getRepositoryRoot()` method using `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
  - Added `getRepositoryIdentifier()` method for normalized path handling
  - Updated `analyze()` method to use enhanced repository detection
  - Added 6 new test cases for repository identification methods
  - All 64 tests passing (16 git analyzer tests including enhanced repo
    identification)
  - Fixed test format issues with git log output parsing

- ‚úÖ **Step 20:** CLI Repository Integration Tests
  - Updated `resumeCommand` to be repository-aware, filtering contexts by
    current repo
  - Updated `listCommand` to be repository-aware, filtering contexts by current
    repo
  - Enhanced error messages to be repository-specific (e.g., "No contexts found
    for this repository")
  - Graceful fallback to global behavior when not in a git repository
  - Created comprehensive CLI integration tests (4 new test scenarios)
  - All 68 tests passing (4 CLI repository integration tests added)

- ‚úÖ **Step 21:** Data Migration Strategy
  - Implemented automatic detection of legacy contexts missing `repositoryInfo`
  - Added migration logic that derives repository info from
    `gitContext.repositoryPath`
  - Handles edge cases (missing repositoryPath defaults to "unknown")
  - Preserves all existing data during migration process
  - User-friendly migration messages shown during storage initialization
  - Created comprehensive migration tests (4 new test scenarios covering all
    edge cases)
  - All 72 tests passing (4 storage migration tests added)

- ‚úÖ **Step 22:** End-to-End Repository Isolation Testing
  - Created comprehensive end-to-end tests simulating real developer workflows
    across multiple repositories
  - Verified complete workflow: save contexts in different repos ‚Üí resume shows
    only current repo contexts
  - Tested list command filtering with proper repository isolation
  - Verified legacy data migration works end-to-end with repository isolation
  - Tested mixed modern/legacy contexts maintain proper isolation after
    migration
  - Verified graceful fallback to global behavior when git repository detection
    fails
  - All 77 tests passing (5 comprehensive end-to-end repository isolation tests
    added)

## üéâ PHASE 7 COMPLETE: REPOSITORY CONTEXT ISOLATION FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**‚úÖ ALL STEPS COMPLETED:** Repository isolation feature is production-ready!

## Development Workflow

### TDD Cycle

1. Write failing test
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor
4. Run `deno test`
5. Build and test executable: `deno task build && ./bin/brain`

### Commands for Development

```bash
# Development
deno task dev                    # Run in development mode
deno test --allow-all tests/     # Run all tests

# Build & Install
deno task build                  # Build single executable
deno task build-all             # Build cross-platform
deno task install               # Install globally for testing

# Testing Installation
./bin/brain --help              # Test local executable
brain --version                 # Test global installation
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Local-First Approach

- All data stored in `~/.config/brain/`
- No cloud storage or data sharing
- Works offline except for AI analysis

### AI Integration Strategy

- OpenAI API for context interpretation
- Graceful degradation when API unavailable
- User controls AI usage via `--no-ai` flag

### Cross-Platform Distribution

- Compiled executables for major platforms
- Single binary with no runtime dependencies
- Easy installation without package managers

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Core modules tested in isolation
- Mocked external dependencies (git, OpenAI API)
- Edge cases and error conditions covered

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end command execution
- Git repository integration
- File system operations

### Executable Tests

- Cross-platform compatibility
- Installation and uninstallation
- Performance benchmarks

## Notes for Claude Code

This project follows a strict TDD approach. Each feature should:

1. Start with failing tests that define the expected behavior
2. Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Build and test the executable after each major change

The goal is a robust, cross-platform CLI tool that developers can rely on for
context management during their daily work.
