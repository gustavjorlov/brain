# Brain CLI Tool - Development Progress

## Project Overview

**Brain** is a CLI tool that solves the context-switching problem for developers with busy family lives. It captures your current thoughts along with git activity, uses AI to interpret the technical context, and helps you seamlessly resume where you left off.

### Core Commands
- `brain save "debugging auth middleware - tokens expiring randomly"` - Capture current context
- `brain resume` - Show last context with AI analysis and suggested next steps
- `brain list` - View recent context history
- `brain config` - Manage settings and API keys

### Tech Stack
- **Runtime:** Deno (TypeScript)
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API
- **Storage:** Local JSON files in `~/.config/brain/`
- **Distribution:** Compiled cross-platform executables

## Development Workflow

### TDD Cycle
1. Write failing test
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor
4. Run `deno test`
5. Build and test executable: `deno task build && ./bin/brain`

### Commands for Development
```bash
# Development
deno task dev                    # Run in development mode
deno test --allow-all tests/     # Run all tests

# Build & Install
deno task build                  # Build single executable
deno task build-all             # Build cross-platform
deno task install               # Install globally for testing

# Testing Installation
./bin/brain --help              # Test local executable
brain --version                 # Test global installation
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Local-First Approach
- All data stored in `~/.config/brain/`
- No cloud storage or data sharing
- Works offline except for AI analysis

### AI Integration Strategy
- OpenAI API for context interpretation
- Graceful degradation when API unavailable
- User controls AI usage via `--no-ai` flag

### Cross-Platform Distribution
- Compiled executables for major platforms
- Single binary with no runtime dependencies
- Easy installation without package managers

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Core modules tested in isolation
- Mocked external dependencies (git, OpenAI API)
- Edge cases and error conditions covered

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end command execution
- Git repository integration
- File system operations

### Executable Tests
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Installation and uninstallation
- Performance benchmarks

## Notes for Claude Code

This project follows a strict TDD approach. Each feature should:
1. Start with failing tests that define the expected behavior
2. Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Build and test the executable after each major change

The goal is a robust, cross-platform CLI tool that developers can rely on for context management during their daily work.
